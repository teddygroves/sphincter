	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way
	            to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and
	            model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic
	            programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian
	            models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding
	            constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many
	            remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to
	            solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills,
	            subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of
	            the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these
	            aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of
	            applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also
	            includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and
	            troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding,
	            and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in
	            the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice
	            we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if
	            only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our

	            for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from
	            two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of
	            specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based
	            on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the
	            parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired
	            property that there is no possibility of specifying separately
	            information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for
	            the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly
	            identified parameters, such as the logistic regression
	            coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes
	            solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of
	            effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of
	            formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the
	            sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices
	            are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more
	            unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover,
	            we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the
	            regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level
	            of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new
	            prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the
	            spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the
	            original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an
	            infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real
	            world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical

	abstract = {Early detection of neurodegeneration, and prediction of when
	            neurodegenerative diseases will lead to symptoms, are critical
	            for developing and initiating disease modifying treatments for
	            these disorders. While each neurodegenerative disease has a
	            typical pattern of early changes in the brain, these disorders
	            are heterogeneous, and early manifestations can vary greatly
	            across people. Methods for detecting emerging neurodegeneration
	            in any part of the brain are therefore needed. Prior publications
	            have described the use of Bayesian linear mixed-effects (BLME)
	            modeling for characterizing the trajectory of change across the
	            brain in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative
	            disease. Here, we use an extension of such a model to detect
	            emerging neurodegeneration in cognitively healthy individuals at
	            risk for dementia. We use BLME to quantify individualized rates
	            of volume loss across the cerebral cortex from the first two MRIs
	            in each person and then extend the BLME model to predict future
	            values for each voxel. We then compare observed values at
	            subsequent time points with the values that were expected from
	            the initial rates of change and identify voxels that are lower
	            than the expected values, indicating accelerated volume loss and
	            neurodegeneration. We apply the model to longitudinal imaging
	            data from cognitively normal participants in the Alzheimer's
	            Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), some of whom subsequently
	            developed dementia, and two cognitively normal cases who
	            developed pathology-proven frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	            (FTLD). These analyses identified regions of accelerated volume
	            loss prior to or accompanying the earliest symptoms, and
	            expanding across the brain over time, in all cases. The changes
	            were detected in regions that are typical for the likely diseases
	            affecting each patient, including medial temporal regions in
	            patients at risk for Alzheimer's disease, and insular, frontal,
	            and/or anterior/inferior temporal regions in patients with likely
	            or proven FTLD. In the cases where detailed histories were
	            available, the first regions identified were consistent with
	            early symptoms. Furthermore, survival analysis in the ADNI cases
	            demonstrated that the rate of spread of accelerated volume loss
	            across the brain was a statistically significant predictor of
	            time to conversion to dementia. This method for detection of
	            neurodegeneration is a potentially promising approach for
	            identifying early changes due to a variety of diseases, without
	            prior assumptions about what regions are most likely to be
	            affected first in an individual.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in
	            popularity due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple
	            levels of dependency and model different data types. For small
	            sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be
	            unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult
	            to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been
	            hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty
	            in specifying prior distributions with variance components again
	            being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous
	            approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs
	            and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace
	            approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples,
	            carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities
	            in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types
	            including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively
	            complicated spline model for which we examine our prior
	            specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We
	            conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for
	            GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based
	            approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with
	            likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the
	            analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies
	            may be less accurate for such data.},

It offers an intuitive, readable syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. PyMC leverages the symbolic computation library PyTensor, allowing it to be compiled into a variety of computational backends, such as C, JAX, and Numba, which in turn offer access to different computational architectures including CPU, GPU, and TPU. Being a general modeling framework, PyMC supports a variety of models including generalized hierarchical linear regression and classification, time series, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and non-parametric models such as Gaussian processes (GPs). We demonstrate PyMC’s versatility and ease of use with examples spanning a range of common statistical models.
