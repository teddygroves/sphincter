  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

It is shown that the log change defined by loge (v/x) is the only symmetric, additive, and normed indicator of relative change. It is proposed that the values of the log change in percent, 100 loge(y/x), be denoted by the symbol L\%, the log percentage. It is hoped that the symmetric and additive log percentages will gradually replace the ordinary asymmetric and nonadditive percentages.},

  abstract = {We propose a model-based method to cluster units within a panel. The underlying model is autoregressive and non-Gaussian, allowing for both skewness and fat tails, and the units are clustered according to their dynamic behavior, equilibrium level, and the effect of covariates. Inference is addressed from a Bayesian perspective, and model comparison is conducted using Bayes factors. Particular attention is paid to prior elicitation and posterior propriety. We suggest priors that require little subjective input and have hierarchical structures that enhance inference robustness. We apply our methodology to GDP growth of European regions and to employment growth of Spanish firms.},

  abstract = {While conceptually simple, Bayesian methods can be mathematically and numerically challenging. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) implement functions to easily build Bayesian models together with efficient automatic inference methods. This helps separate the model building from the inference, allowing practitioners to focus on their specific problems and leaving PPLs to handle the computational details for them (Bessiere, Mazer, Ahuactzin, \& Mekhnacha, 2013; Daniel Roy, 2015; Ghahramani, 2015). The inference process generates a posterior distribution \textemdash{} which has a central role in Bayesian statistics \textemdash{} together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivate the inference process.},
