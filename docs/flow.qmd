Our measurements included flow data recording the measured speed and flux of red
blood cells through some vessels. This data is interesting because it allows for
inference of the local blood pressure, which determines the speed. 

We were interested in whether the speed and flux tended to be different between
old and adult mice for a given vessel type and treatment, as this would indicate
that the pressure would likely be similar as well.

## Data

There is a significant missing data issue in this case: speed and flux
measurements were available for only XXX out of XXX measurements.

Questions:

- [] Which data to use: flux or speed (or both)?
- [] Should we include the hypertension treatments?
